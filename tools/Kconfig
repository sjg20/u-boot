	string "Path to dtc binary for use within mkimage"
	default "dtc"
	help
	  The mkimage host tool will, in order to generate FIT images make
	  calls to the dtc application in order to create the output.  In
	  some cases the system dtc may not support all required features
	  and the path to a different version should be given here.

	default y
	help
	  Cryptographic signature, verification, and encryption of images is
	  provided by host tools using OpenSSL's libcrypto. Select 'n' here if
	  you wish to build host tools without OpenSSL. mkimage will not have
	  the ability to sign images.
	  This selection does not affect target features, such as runtime FIT
	  signature verification.
