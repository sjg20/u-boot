config NVDATA_CROS_EC
	bool "Non-volatile data driver that uses the Chromium OS EC"
	help
	  This stores non-volatile data in the EC. This data may be lost when
	  the EC is reset but that does not happen often (Esc-Power-Refresh,
	  running out of battery, etc.). This driver supports CROS_NV_DATA and
	  CROS_NV_VSTORE.

config TPL_NVDATA_CROS_EC
	bool "Non-volatile data driver that uses the Chromium OS EC in TPL"
	help
	  This stores non-volatile data in the EC. This data may be lost when
	  the EC is reset but that does not happen often (Esc-Power-Refresh,
	  running out of battery, etc.). This driver supports CROS_NV_DATA and
	  CROS_NV_VSTORE.

config VPL_NVDATA_CROS_EC
	bool "Non-volatile data driver that uses the Chromium OS EC in VPL"
	help
	  This stores non-volatile data in the EC. This data may be lost when
	  the EC is reset but that does not happen often (Esc-Power-Refresh,
	  running out of battery, etc.). This driver supports CROS_NV_DATA and
	  CROS_NV_VSTORE.

config NVDATA_TPM
	bool "Non-volatile data driver that uses the TPM"
	help
	  This stores non-volatile data in the EC. This data is retained until
	  the TPM is reset and cleared, typically after a 'power wash' cycle
	  causes the device to enter the initial OOBE (Out-of-Box-Experience)
	  screen. This driver supports CROS_NV_SECDATAF, CROS_NV_SECDATAK and
	  CROS_NV_MRC_REC_HASH types.

config SPL_NVDATA_TPM
	bool "Non-volatile data driver that uses the TPM in SPL"
	help
	  Enables support for storing NV data in the TPM within SPL. This must
	  normally be enabled since SPL typically accesses the data to find
	  out what action to take.

	  For sandbox there is a little quirk in that the TPM driver only
	  writes its data to the state.dtb file if it has been probed, so this
	  option generally must be enabled within SPL even if the driver is not
	  actually used. Otherwise the data is lost when jumping to U-Boot
	  proper.

config TPL_NVDATA_TPM
	bool "Non-volatile data driver that uses the TPM in TPL"
	help
	  Enables support for storing NV data in the TPM within TPL. This must
	  normally be enabled if TPL typically accesses the data to find
	  out what action to take - e.g. whether to jump to the A SPL or the B
	  SPL.

config VPL_NVDATA_TPM
	bool "Non-volatile data driver that uses the TPM in VPL"
	help
	  Enables support for storing NV data in the TPM within VPL. This must
	  normally be enabled since VPL typically accesses the data to find
	  out what action to take - e.g. whether to jump to the A SPL or the B
	  SPL.

config NVDATA_CMOS
	bool "Non-volatile data driver that uses CMOS RAM"
	select DM_RTC
	help
	  For devices which have battery-backed CMOS RAM it is possible to
	  store non-volatile data into this instead of the EC. This data is
	  preserved so long as the Real-Time Clock (RTC) retains power.
	  Typically this survives even an EC restart. This driver supports only
	  the CROS_NV_DATA type.

config VPL_NVDATA_CMOS
	bool "Non-volatile data driver that uses CMOS RAM in VPL"
	select VPL_DM_RTC
	select VPL_RTC_SUPPORT
	help
	  For devices which have battery-backed CMOS RAM it is possible to
	  store non-volatile data into this instead of the EC. This data is
	  preserved so long as the Real-Time Clock (RTC) retains power.
	  Typically this survives even an EC restart. This driver supports only
	  the CROS_NV_DATA type.
