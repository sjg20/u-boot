Chromium OS dts config bindings
=============================

faft-key-remap-ascii - Array for simple ascii key remap.
 You may remap up to three keys if the GBB flag is set.
 Keys are paired with incoming key and remapped key.
 example remap '\' to SPACE:
     faft-key-remap-ascii = <0x5c 0x0D 0 0 0 0>;

faft-key-remap-special - Array for special key remap.
 You may remap up to three keys if the GBB flag is set.
 Keys are paired with incoming key and remapped key.
 Special keys are pre-stripped of ESCAPE and '['.
 example remap 'F9' to ENTER:
 faft-key-remap-special = <0x32 0x20 0 0 0 0>;

kernel-offset
  location (offset into DRAM and size) of the memory area allocated for
  kernel blob on Exynos platforms.

deactivate-tpm
	Deactivate the TPM on startup. If enabled then the TPM is deactivated
	and the device is rebooted so that verified boot starts in that state.

detachable-ui
	Support a menu for use with devices with a detachable keyboard. This
	changes the UI for verified boot to a separate version which only needs
	up/down/select to operate.

disable-dev-on-rec
	Disable entry to developer mode from recovery

disable-memwipe
	Disable memory wipe, ie, bypass function wipe_unused_memory(). This
	flag is useful for boards where memory wipe is not absolutely needed
	because it may save a few seconds of boot time.

disable-power-button-during-update
	Don't allow the power button to be used when updating aux firmware

disable-lid-shutdown-during-update
	Don't allow a lid closure to cause the machine to shut down when
	updating aux firmware

ec-efs
	EC uses early firmware selection

ec-slow-update
	Updating the EC is slow, so a warning screen is needed.

ec-software-sync
	Use software sync for EC updates. This is where the AP checks a hash
	and sends new software to the EC

resume-path-same-as-boot
	Indicates that when a system resumes it takes the same path as a regular
	boot, e.g. an x86 system runs from the reset vector at 0xfffffff0 on
	both resume and warm/cold boot.

meminit-in-readonly-code
	Memory init code is in read-only flash

oprom-matters
	Indicates that an option ROM is needed to init the display

physical-dev-switch
	There is a physical switch for developer mode (rather than a setting in
	the TPM).

physical-rec-switch
	There is a physical switch for recovery mode (rather than a setting in
	the TPM).

recovery-mode-mrc
	Recovery mode has a memory-reference-code (MRC) area where signed
	memory parameters are kept. This is done on some Intel platforms where
	memory init is so slow that users thing the machine is broken when
	trying to get to recovery mode.

vboot2-work-buffer-size
	Size of the vboot2 work buffer. Should normaly be 0x3000.
