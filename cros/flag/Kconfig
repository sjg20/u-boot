config CROS_FLAG
	bool "Chromium OS verified boot flags"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Chromium OS includes a number of features which are controlled by
	  hardware such as GPIOs or TPM settings. This uclass implements a
	  way of reading these 'vboot' flags, with the each driver advertising
	  the flags it can read and a method for reading those flags.

	  Flags are normally read using vboot_flag_read_walk(). This checks each
	  driver to find the one that implements the requested flag.

	  Typically the flag values do not change value over the course of a
	  boot, but this is not always true. For example, VBOOT_FLAG_LID_OPEN
	  is 1 when the lid is open on a clamshell device, and 0 if the lid is
	  closed. In this case vboot_flag_read_walk_prev() can be used to read
	  the current value of the flag, along with the previous value. This
	  allows transitions to be detected.

config CROS_FLAG_GPIO
	bool "Flags controlled by a GPIO"
	depends on CROS_FLAG
	help
	  Enable support for a Chromium OS flag which is controlled by a GPIO.
	  The flag is 1 if the GPIO is high and 0 if the GPIO is low.

	  For sandbox only, the initial value of the flag can be provided in
	  the device tree, for testing purposes.

config CROS_FLAG_CONST
	bool "Flags controlled by a constant"
	depends on CROS_FLAG
	help
	  Enable support for a Chromium OS flag which is always the same value,
	  as specified by the device-tree node. The value does not change at
	  all over the life of the verified boot session. This can be useful
	  for flags which are not supported on a particular platform.

config CROS_FLAG_KEY
	bool "Flags controlled by a keypress"
	depends on CROS_FLAG && SANDBOX
	help
	  Enable support for a Chromium OS flag which is controlled by a
	  keypress captured early during start-up. This is only provided for
	  use with sandbox. A short delay at start-up allows capturing the
	  keys to be read by this driver - see cros_ec_check_keyboard().

config CROS_FLAG_SYSINFO
	bool "Flags controlled by coreboot sysinfo"
	depends on CROS_FLAG && X86
	help
	  Enable support for a Chromium OS flag which is controlled by
	  information received by coreboot in its 'sysinfo' structure. This is
	  used when coreboot is the first bootloader and it chain-loads into
	  U-Boot. Since many of the flags can only be read very early in boot,
	  this provides a way to keep a consistent flag value throughout the
	  boot.
