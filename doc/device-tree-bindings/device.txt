Devices
=======

Device bindings are described by their own individual binding files.

U-Boot provides for some optional properties which are documented here.

 - acpi,has-power-resource : (boolean) true if this device has a power resource.
    This causes a PRIC (ACPI PowerResource) to be written containing the
    properties provided by this binding, to describe how to handle powering the
    device up and down using GPIOs
 - acpi,cid : Contains the string to use as the compatible ID (_CID)
 - acpi,compatible : compatible string to report
 - acpi,desc : Contains the string to use as the _DDN (DOS (Disk Operating
    System) Device Name)
 - acpi,hid : Contains the string to use as the HID (Human Interface Device)
    identifier _HID
 - acpi,hid-desc-reg-offset : HID register offset (for Human Interface Devices)
 - acpi,probed : Tells U-Boot to add 'linux,probed' to the ACPI tables so that
    Linux will not re-init the device
 - acpi,name : Provides the ACPI name for a device, which is a string consisting
   of four alphanumeric character (upper case)
 - acpi,uid : _UID value for device


Example
-------

synaptics_touchpad: synaptics-touchpad@2c {
	compatible = "i2c-chip";
	reg = <0x2c>;
	acpi,hid = "PNP0C50";
	acpi,cid = "PNP0C50";
	acpi,desc = "Synaptics Touchpad";
	interrupts-extended = <&acpi_gpe GPIO_18_IRQ
			IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;
	acpi,probed;
	acpi,hid-desc-reg-offset = <0x20>;
};

pcie-a0@14,0 {
	reg = <0x0000a000 0 0 0 0>;
	acpi,name = "RP01";
	wifi: wifi {
		compatible = "intel,generic-wifi";
		acpi,desc = "Intel WiFi";
		acpi,name = "WF00";
		interrupts-extended = <&acpi_gpe 0x3c 0>;
	};
};
