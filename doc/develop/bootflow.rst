U-Boot Bootflow
===============

Introduction
------------

Bootflow provides a built-in way for U-Boot to automatically boot
an Operating System without custom scripting and other customisation. It
consists of the following concepts:

   - bootdev - a device which can hold a distro
   - bootmeth - a method to scan a bootdev to find bootflows (owned by U-Boot)
   - bootflow - a description of how to boot (owned by the distro)

For Linux, the distro (Linux distribution, e.g. Debian, Fedora) is responsible
for creating a bootflow for each kernel combination that it wants to offer.
These bootflows are stored on media so they can be discovered by U-Boot.

This feature is typically called `distro boot` (see :doc:`distro`) because it is
a way for distributions to boot on any hardware.

Traditionally U-Boot has relied on scripts to implement this feature. See
disto_boodcmd_ for details. This is done because U-Boot has no native support
for scanning devices. While the scripts work remarkably well, they can be hard
to understand and extend, and the feature does not include tests.

Bootdev, bootmeth and bootflow together provide a more built-in way to boot with
U-Boot. The feature is extensible to different Operating Systems (such as
Chromium OS) and devices (beyond just block and network devices).


Bootflow
--------

A bootflow is a file that describes how to boot a distro. Conceptually there can
be different formats for that file but at present U-Boot only supports the
BootLoaderSpec_ format. which looks something like this::

   menu autoboot Welcome to Fedora-Workstation-armhfp-31-1.9. Automatic boot in # second{,s}. Press a key for options.
   menu title Fedora-Workstation-armhfp-31-1.9 Boot Options.
   menu hidden

   label Fedora-Workstation-armhfp-31-1.9 (5.3.7-301.fc31.armv7hl)
       kernel /vmlinuz-5.3.7-301.fc31.armv7hl
       append ro root=UUID=9732b35b-4cd5-458b-9b91-80f7047e0b8a rhgb quiet LANG=en_US.UTF-8 cma=192MB cma=256MB
       fdtdir /dtb-5.3.7-301.fc31.armv7hl/
       initrd /initramfs-5.3.7-301.fc31.armv7hl.img

As you can see it specifies a kernel, a ramdisk (initrd) and a directory from
which to load devicetree files. The details are described in disto_boodcmd_.

The bootflow is provided by the distro. It is not part of U-Boot. U-Boot's job
is simply to interpret the file and carry out the instructions. This allows
distros to boot on essentially any device supported by U-Boot.

Typically the first available bootflow is selected and booted. If that fails,
then the next one is tried.


Bootdev
-------

Where does U-Boot find the media that holds the operating systems? That is the
job of bootdev. A bootdev is simply a layer on top of a a media device (such as
MMC, NVMe) that contains filesystems that might contain things related to an
operating system.

For example, an MMC bootdev provides access to the individual partitions on the
MMC device. It scans through these to find filesystems, then provides a list of
these for consideration.


Bootmeth
--------

Once the list of filesystems is provided, how does U-Boot find the bootflow
files in these filesystems. That is the job of bootmeth. Each boot method has
its own way of doing this.

For example, the distro boot simply scans through the provide filesystems
looking for files called `extlinux/extlinux.conf`. Each of those files
constitutes a bootflow, so the bootmeth may produce multiple bootflows.

Note: it is possible to have a bootmeth that uses a partition or a device
directly, but it is more common to use a filesystem.


Boot process
------------

U-Boot tries to use the 'lazy init' approach whereever possible and distro boot
is no exception. The algorithm is::

   while (get next bootdev)
      while (get next bootmeth)
          while (get next bootflow)
              try to boot it

So U-Boot works its way through the bootdevs, trying each bootmeth in turn to
obtain bootflows, until it either boots or exhausts the available options.

Instead of 500 lines of #defines and a 4KB boot script, all that is needed is
the following command::

   bootflow scan -lb

which scans for available bootflows, listing each find it finds (-l) and trying
to boot it (-b).


Bootdev uclass
--------------

The bootdev uclass provides an simple API call to obtain a bootflows from a
device::

   int bootdev_get_bootflow(struct udevice *dev, struct bootflow_iter *iter,
                            struct bootflow *bflow);

This takes a iterator which indicates the bootdev, partition and bootmeth to
use. It returns a bootflow. This is the core of the bootdev implementation. The
bootdev drivers that implement this differ depending on the media they are
reading from, but each is responsible for returning a valid bootflow if
available.

A helper called `bootdev_find_in_blk()` makes it fairly easy to implement this
function for each media device uclass, in a few lines of code.


Bootdev drivers
---------------

A bootdev driver is typically fairly simple. Here is one for mmc::

    static int mmc_get_bootflow(struct udevice *dev, struct bootflow_iter *iter,
                                struct bootflow *bflow)
    {
        struct udevice *mmc_dev = dev_get_parent(dev);
        struct udevice *blk;
        int ret;

        ret = mmc_get_blk(mmc_dev, &blk);
        /*
         * If there is no media, indicate that no more partitions should be
         * checked
         */
        if (ret == -EOPNOTSUPP)
            ret = -ESHUTDOWN;
        if (ret)
            return log_msg_ret("blk", ret);
        assert(blk);
        ret = bootdev_find_in_blk(dev, blk, iter, bflow);
        if (ret)
            return log_msg_ret("find", ret);

        return 0;
    }

    struct bootdev_ops mmc_bootdev_ops = {
        .get_bootflow    = mmc_get_bootflow,
    };

    U_BOOT_DRIVER(mmc_bootdev) = {
        .name      = "mmc_bootdev",
        .id        = UCLASS_BOOTDEV,
        .ops       = &mmc_bootdev_ops,
    };

The implementation of the `get_bootflow` method is simply to obtain the
block device and call a bootdev helper function to do the rest. The
implementation of `bootdev_find_in_blk()` checks the partition table, and
attempts to read a file from a filesystem on the partition number given by the
@iter->part parameter.


Device hierarchy
----------------

A bootdev device is a child of the media device. In this example, you can see
that the bootdev is a sibling of the block device and both are children of
media device::

    mmc           0  [ + ]   bcm2835-sdhost        |   |-- mmc@7e202000
    blk           0  [ + ]   mmc_blk               |   |   |-- mmc@7e202000.blk
    bootdev       0  [   ]   mmc_bootdev           |   |   `-- mmc@7e202000.bootdev
    mmc           1  [ + ]   sdhci-bcm2835         |   |-- sdhci@7e300000
    blk           1  [   ]   mmc_blk               |   |   |-- sdhci@7e300000.blk
    bootdev       1  [   ]   mmc_bootdev           |   |   `-- sdhci@7e300000.bootdev

The bootdev device is typically created automatically in the media uclass'
`post_bind()` method. This is typically something like this::

    ret = bootdev_setup_for_dev(dev, "eth_bootdev");
        if (ret)
            return log_msg_ret("bootdev", ret);

Here, `eth_bootdev` is the name of the Ethernet bootdev driver and `dev`
is the ethernet device. This function is safe to call even if bootdev is
not enabled, since it does nothing in that case. It can be added to all uclasses
which implement suitable media.


Using devicetree
----------------

If a bootdev is complicated or needs configuration information, it can be
added to the devicetree as a child of the media device. For example, imagine a
bootdev which reads a bootflow from SPI flash. The devicetree fragment might
look like this::

    spi@0 {
        flash@0 {
            reg = <0>;
            compatible = "spansion,m25p16", "jedec,spi-nor";
            spi-max-frequency = <40000000>;

            bootdev {
                compatible = "sf-bootdev";
                offset = <0x2000>;
                size = <0x1000>;
            };
        };
    };

The `sf-bootdev` driver can implement a way to read from the SPI flash, using
the offset and size provided, and return that bootflow file back to the caller.
When distro boot wants to read the kernel it calls disto_getfile() which must
provide a way to read from the SPI flash. See `distro_boot()` at distro_boot_
for more details.

Of course this is all internal to U-Boot. All the distro sees is another way
to boot.


Configuration
-------------

The bootdev/bootflow feature can be enabled with `CONFIG_BOOTDEV`. Each
type of bootflow has its own CONFIG option also. For example,
`CONFIG_BOOTDEV_DISTRO` enables support for distro boot from a disk.


Available bootmeth drivers
--------------------------

Bootmeth drivers are provided for:

   - distro boot from a disk (syslinux)
   - distro boot from a network (PXE)
   - EFI boot using bootefi


Command interface
-----------------

Two commands are available:

`bootdev`
    Allows listing of available bootdevs, selecting a particular one and
    getting information about it. See :doc:`../usage/bootdev`

`bootflow`
    Allows scanning one or more bootdevs for bootflows, listing available
    bootflows, selecting one, obtaining information about it and booting it.
    See :doc:`../usage/bootflow`


.. _BootflowStates:

Bootflow states
---------------

Here is a list of states that a bootflow can be in:

=======  =======================================================================
State    Meaning
=======  =======================================================================
base     Starting-out state, indicates that no media/partition was found. For an
         SD card socket it may indicate that the card is not inserted.
media    Media was found (e.g. SD card is inserted) but no partition information
         was found. It might lack a partition table or have a read error.
part     Partition was found but a filesystem could not be read. This could be
         because the partition does not hold a filesystem or the filesystem is
         very corrupted.
fs       Filesystem was found but the file could not be read. It could be
         missing or in the wrong subdirectory.
file     File was found and its size detected, but it could not be read. This
         could indicate filesystem corruption.
ready    File was loaded and is ready for use. In this state the bootflow is
         ready to be booted.
=======  =======================================================================


Bootflow internals
------------------

The bootflow uclass holds a linked list of scanned bootflows as well as the
currently selected bootdev and bootflow (for use by commands). This is in
`struct bootstd_priv`.

Each bootdev device has its own `struct bootdev_uc_plat` which holds a
list of scanned bootflows just for that device.

The bootflow itself is documented in bootflow_h_. It includes various bits of
information about the bootflow and a buffer to hold the file.


Future
------

Apart from the to-do items below, different types of bootflow files may be
implemented in future, e.g. EFI support and Chromium OS support.


To do
-----

Most of the following things will be completd as part of initial development,
before a final series is sent:

- `bootflow prep` to load everything preparing for boot, so that `bootflow boot`
  can just do the boot.
- check ordering of bootdevs (should it use aliases?)
- check ordering of bootflows within bootdevs (needed)
- implement boot_targets env var?
- quick way to boot from particular media - 'bootflow boot mmc1' ?
- add bootdev drivers for dhcp, sata, scsi, ide, usb, virtio

Other ideas:

- bootdev flags for speed (e.g. network and USB are slow)
- automatically load kernel, FDT, etc. to suitable addresses so the board does
  not need to specific things like `pxefile_addr_r`
