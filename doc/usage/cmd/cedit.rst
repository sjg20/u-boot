cedit command
=============

Synopis
-------

::

    cedit load <interface> <dev[:part]> <filename>
    cedit run

Description
-----------

The *cedit* command is used to load a configuration-editor description and allow
the user to interact with it.

It makes use of the expo subsystem.

The description is in the form of a devicetree file, as documented at
:ref:`expo_format`.

See :doc:`../../develop/cedit` for information about the configuration editor.

cedit load
~~~~~~~~~~

Loads a configuration-editor description from a file. It creates a new cedit
structure ready for use. Initially no settings are read, so default values are
used for each object.

cedit run
~~~~~~~~~

Runs the default configuration-editor event loop. This is very simply, just
accepting character input and moving through the objects under user control.
The implementation is at `cedit_run()`.


Example
-------

::

    => cedit load hostfs - fred.dtb
    => cedit run
