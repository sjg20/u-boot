config FS_FAT
	bool "Enable FAT filesystem support"
	help
	  This provides support for reading images from File Allocation Table
	  (FAT) filesystem. FAT filesystem is a legacy, lightweight filesystem.
	  It is useful mainly for its wide compatibility with various operating
	  systems. You can also enable CMD_FAT to get access to fat commands.

config FAT_WRITE
	bool "Enable FAT filesystem write support"
	depends on FS_FAT
	help
	  This provides support for creating and writing new files to an
	  existing FAT filesystem partition.

config FS_FAT_MAX_CLUSTSIZE
	int "Set maximum possible clustersize"
	default 65536
	depends on FS_FAT
	help
	  Set the maximum possible clustersize for the FAT filesytem. This
	  is the smallest amount of disk space that can be used to hold a
	  file. Unless you have an extremely tight memory memory constraints,
	  leave the default.

config FAT_BLK_XLATE
	bool "Enable FAT filesystem on a device with a larger block size"
	depends on FS_FAT
	help
	  This provides a simple translation mechanism for reading FAT
	  filesystems which don't use the same sector size as the underlying
	  media. For example, the FAT filesystem may use 512 bytes but the
	  media uses 2048, e.g. on a CDROM drive.

	  This only supports the case where the FAT filesystem's sector size is
	  smaller than the media's block size. It does not support creating or
	  writing files.
