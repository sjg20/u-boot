config INTEL_SOC
	bool
	help
	  This is enabled on Intel SoCs that can support various advanced
	  features such as power management (requiring asm/arch/pm.h), system
	  agent (asm/arch/systemagent.h) and an I/O map for ACPI
	  (asm/arch/iomap.h).

	  This cannot be selected in a defconfig file. It must be enabled by a
	  'select' in the SoC's Kconfig.

config INTEL_ACPIGEN
	bool "Support ACPI table generation for Intel SoCs"
	depends on ACPIGEN
	help
	  This option adds some functions used for programmatic generation of
	  ACPI tables on Intel SoCs. This provides features for writing CPU
	  information such as P states and T stages. Also included is a way
	  to create a GNVS table and set it up.

config INTEL_GMA_ACPI
	bool "Generate ACPI table for Intel GMA graphics"
	help
	  The Intel GMA graphics driver in Linux expects an ACPI table
	  which describes the layout of the registers and the display
	  connected to the device. Enable this option to create this
	  table so that graphics works correctly.

config INTEL_GENERIC_WIFI
	bool "Enable generation of ACPI tables for Intel WiFi"
	help
	  Select this option to provide code to a build generic WiFi ACPI table
	  for Intel WiFi devices. This is not a WiFi driver and offers no
	  network functionality. It is only here to generate the ACPI tables
	  required by Linux.

config INTEL_GMA_SWSMISCI
	bool
	help
	  Select this option for Atom-based platforms which use the SWSMISCI
	  register (0xe0) rather than the SWSCI register (0xe8).

config HAVE_ITSS
	bool "Enable ITSS"
	help
	  Select this to include the driver for the Interrupt Timer
	  Subsystem (ITSS) which is found on several Intel devices.

config HAVE_P2SB
	bool "Enable P2SB"
	depends on P2SB
	help
	  Select this to include the driver for the Primary to
	  Sideband Bridge (P2SB) which is found on several Intel
	  devices.

config INTEL_CAR_CQOS
	bool "Support Intel Cache Quality of Service"
	help
	  Cache Quality of Service allows more fine-grained control of cache
	  usage. As result, it is possible to set up a portion of L2 cache for
	  CAR and use the remainder for actual caching.

#
# Each bit in QOS mask controls this many bytes. This is calculated as:
# (CACHE_WAYS / CACHE_BITS_PER_MASK) * CACHE_LINE_SIZE * CACHE_SETS
